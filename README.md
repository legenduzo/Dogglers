## Fetched from Dogglers Starter Code

https://github.com/google-developer-training/android-basics-kotlin-dogglers-app

The Dogglers app is a nod to the good dogs of Google, hence the application's name. I also just realized that the app's namse is a play on the name 'Douglas'

### App screenshots and description


1. This is the entry point of the application, giving you options to use the layout you choose.



2. The vertical view allows you to view the beautiful dogs vertically


3. The horizontal view displays cards individually allowing you to scroll horizontally to view images


4. The grid view arranges images in 2 by 2 grids for convenience.

The application helped me get hands-on experience in using RecyclerView and Adapter to display data within an application.
